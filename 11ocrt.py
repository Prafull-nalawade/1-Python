# Machine learning Definition

# A computer programm is said to learn from experience E with respect to some 
# class of task T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T as measured:
# by P , improves With experience E

#  machine learning type
# !) supervised learning
#     This is like teaching a computer with labeled examples. You show the computer lots 
#     of data with answers (like pictures of dogs and cats with labels), and it learns
#     to make predictions or decisions based on that. It's like training a dog to recognize tricks.

# !!) Unsupervised learning 
#     In this type, the computer has to find patterns or structures in data without any 
#     labels. It's like giving the computer a pile of puzzle pieces without the picture 
#     on the box and asking it to figure out how they fit together.

# !!!) reinforcement learning
#     This is like training a computer to make decisions by rewarding it when it does 
#     something right and punishing it when it does something wrong. It's similar to 
#     how we teach a child to ride a bike - they learn from their actions and consequences.
